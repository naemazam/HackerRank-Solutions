# ========================
#       Explanation
#  On the first line, we print the string literal Hello, World.. On the second line, we print the contents of the inputString variable which,
#  for this sample case, happens to be Welcome to 30 Days of Code!. If you do not print the variable’s contents to stdout, you will not pass the hidden test case.
# ========================

# ========================
#         Solution
# ========================

# Read a full line of input from stdin and save it to our dynamically typed variable, input_string.
INPUT_STRING = input()

# Print a string literal saying "Hello, World." to stdout.
print('Hello, World.')

# Write a line of code here that prints the contents of input_string to stdout.
print(INPUT_STRING)
